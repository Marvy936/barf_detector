Hardware used:

Raspberry Pi Zero WH (Zero W with Headers) - test
KY-037 sound sensor
KY-024 hall sensor
Logic converter 5V/3.3V 4-channel
8GB MicroSD card
Jumper cables
N52 magnet

0. Connection

Logic converter:

LV GND -> PIN 6 on Raspberry. (Ground)
HV GND -> PIN 14 on Raspberry. (Ground)
LV -> PIN 1 on Raspberry. (3.3V)
HV -> PIN 2 on Raspberry. (5V)

HALL sensor:

+ -> PIN 4 on Raspberry. (5V)
G -> PIN 9 on Raspberry. (Ground)
D0 -> LV2 on Logic Coverter then HV2 -> PIN 7 on Raspberry. (GPIO4)

Sound sensor:

+ -> PIN 17 on Raspberry. (3.3V)
G -> PIN 39 on Raspberry. (Ground)
D0 -> LV1 on Logic Converter then HV1 -> PIN 4 on Raspberry. (5V)

1. Download etcher and flash Raspberry OS Lite on SD card.

2. After flash we want to create few files.
In main path /boot create just blank empty ssh file. (this will activate ssh on Rasp), then create authorized_keys file with your public key and then we need wpa_supplicant.conf for Wi-Fi settings.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

# wpa_supplicant.conf

country=SK
ctrl_interface=DIR=/var/run/wpa_supplicant GROUP=netdev
update_config=1

network={
    ssid="Wi-Fi name"
    psk="Wi-Fi password"
}

--------------------------------------------------------------------

If your public key wasn't copied in first boot then copy it to /home/pi/.ssh/authorized_keys.

ak sa pripajam cez wifi vytvorim subor s nazvom wpa_supplicant.conf

country=SK
ctrl_interface=DIR=/var/run/wpa_supplicant GROUP=netdev
update_config=1

network={
    ssid="NazovVasejSiete"
    psk="HesloVasejSiete"
}

3. Put SD card into Raspberry and boot it, Rasp will turn on when you plug in power cable.
4. Find IP address of your Rasp in your router. If you can't find IP of Rasp try connect to raspberrypi hostname.
5. SSH to your Raspberry.

$ ssh pi@ip-address

6. After connection run update and upgrades commands.

$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get upgrade
$ sudo apt-get pip
$ sudo apt-get install python3-rpi.gpio
$ pip install pushbullet.py

7. Create bark.py on your Raspberry, insert pushbullet access token and run it. It is all done. Tweak with sensors.
